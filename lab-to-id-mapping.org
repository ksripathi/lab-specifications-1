* Introduction
  This document maps a lab id to a lab name. 

* Assignment

     Rules for assigning a LabId to a Lab
     1. LabId = discipline Id + number
     2. All the legacy lab ids will remain the same
     3. For a new lab, the number that is concatenated to the discipline Id is
        derived in the following way:
        - Fetch the labs in that particular discipline
        - Get the highest number
        - Increment it by one

*Note* - The legacy lab ids are not changed even if the given lab id
 does not match the discipline.
